Daemon program that runs in conjunction with the IL-2 Sturmovik's (c.f., https://il2sturmovik.com/) multiplayer server program, DServer.exe.

Program allows players/pilots to:

1.  Change environmental variables on the fly such as wind direction and speed, temperature, mission start time, cloud conditions, etc.
2.  Reset missions or load from one of several missions.
3.  Play arcade games with leaderboards (e.g., https://il2arcade.neocities.org/).

To see the server in action, load IL-2 and join the _SCG Arcade and Training_ multiplayer server.  Password is "enjoy" (without quoation marks).

This program allows for functionality not found on any other multiplayer training server.
