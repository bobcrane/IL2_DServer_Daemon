Daemon program that runs in conjunction with the _IL-2 Sturmovik: Great Battles_ (https://il2sturmovik.com/) multiplayer server program, DServer.exe.

Program allows players/pilots to:

1.  Change environmental variables on the fly such as wind direction and speed, temperature, mission start time, cloud conditions, etc.
2.  Reset a mission or load a new one from a list of several missions.
3.  Play arcade games with leaderboards (e.g., https://il2arcade.neocities.org/).

To see the server in action, join the _SCG Arcade and Training_ multiplayer server.  Password is "enjoy" (without quoation marks).
Here is a list of server commands available to pilots: https://il2arcade.neocities.org/il2serverscript%20commands.pdf
